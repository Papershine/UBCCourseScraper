# UBCCourseScraper

_A Python script that scrapes for all the undergrad courses and their characteristics from the UBC website_

After running the script, the results will be dumped into `.json` files.

You can access the (not latest) course data using the `.json` files on this repository.

To run the script, run `python3 main.py`.

This script requires `beautifulsoup4` and `requests` to be installed (e.g. from `pip`) in order to function correctly.
